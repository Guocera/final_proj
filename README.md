NutriFilt (http://nutrifilt.herokuapp.com/)
A generator of affordably healthy meal plans built on Django, a Python web framework, that helps individuals keep their waist and wallets healthy. It interacted with the Edamam API (modified to interact with a sample local database) for recipe informations and implemented global optimizing algorithms, Basin-Hopping and Simulated Annealing, to find the cheapest recipe combination that satisfies the user's nutritional requirements. Includes an optional optimization library written in Fortran.
